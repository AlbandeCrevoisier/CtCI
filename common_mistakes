std::
int/uint as a loop index
char: think of ASCII (vector<bool>, ...)
uint: small minus big yields super big: no sign, can't be negative...
Don't use a pointer if you don't need to (struct & all).
. / ->
emplace(element) / insert(it_before_which, it_begin, it_end)
; after struct {}
looping linked list break almost everything.
int() vs int{}
Think about the complexity of the algorithm a bit more.
STL with pointers, not struct.
push / push_back

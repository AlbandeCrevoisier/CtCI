At the end, how many lockers are open? */

Every locker with an odd number of divisors will be open.
For each divisor a, there is a b such that: a * b = n, so we can pair
divisors. The only way of having an odd number is if a * a = n, so the open
lockers will be perfect squares:
1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100.
